bowel,C0021853,Intestines,"Body Part, Organ, or Organ Component","Část zažívacího traktu od ŽALUDKU po ANÁLNÍ KANÁL. Tento pojem zahrnuje jak STŘEVO TLUSTÉ tak i STŘEVO TENKÉ. Úsek trávicího ústrojí, v němž probíhá velká část trávení a vstřebávání živin a vody. Je dlouhé několik metrů a dělí se na dvě hlavní části, tenké střevo (i. tenue) a tlusté střevo (i. crassum). Základní stavba obou částí střeva je v zásadě podobná. Vnitřní částí je sliznice, pod níž je podslizniční vazivo (submukóza) a vrstva hladké svaloviny (tunica muscularis). Zevně střevo obaluje seróza, obdobného charakteru a původu jako pobřišnice. Sliznice tenkého střeva je složena v řasy a poseta střevními klky, které spolu s mikroklky jednotlivých enterocytů výrazně zvyšují plochu pro vstřebávání (dosahuje cca 100 m2). Obsahuje i četné žlázky (vč. buněk chromafinního charakteru) a lymfatickou tkáň. Submukóza je tvořena řídkým vazivem (umožňujícím sliznici skládání do řas), obsahuje Meissnerovu nervovou pleteň (plexus submucosus). Svalovina má silnější vnitřní vrstvu cirkulární a zevní vrstvu longitudinální. Mezi nimi je nervová pleteň (Auerbachův plexus myentericus). (cit.
