 you'll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery.
 There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the 
surgeon cut. Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect. There
 can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the 
operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction
 to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions. Your
 surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do
 - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some 
other questions to ask are:How long you will be in the hospitalWhat kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go homeWhen you can go back to workWhen it is ok to start exercising againAre they any other restrictions in your activities Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.

Post - operative,C0241311,post operative (finding),Finding,"After any operation, you'll have some side effects. There is usually some pain with surgery. There may also be swelling and soreness around the area that the surgeon cut. Your surgeon can tell you which side effects to expect.

There can also be complications. These are unplanned events linked to the operation. Some complications are infection, too much bleeding, reaction to anesthesia, or accidental injury. Some people have a greater risk of complications because of other medical conditions.

Your surgeon can tell you how you might feel and what you will be able to do - or not do - the first few days, weeks, or months after surgery. Some other questions to ask are:

    How long you will be in the hospital
    What kind of supplies, equipment, and help you might need when you go home
    When you can go back to work
    When it is ok to start exercising again
    Are they any other restrictions in your activities

Following your surgeon's advice can help you recover as soon as possible.
