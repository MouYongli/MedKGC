（prompt）


## Evaluation matrix
一共有这几种情况：
gold date有id，prediction有id，一致。
gold date没有id，prediction没有id。

gold date有id，prediction没有id。
gold date没有id，prediction有id。

<!-- note this -->
gold date有id，prediction有id，但是不一致。

fp是gold date没有id，prediction有id。无中生有，或者错了。

fn是gold date有id，prediction没有id。直接没有识别出来。

tp是gold date有id，prediction有id，一致。

tn是gold date没有id，prediction没有id。

precision
recall
f1

## Result
90%的准确率。


## Dissussion.
    error from previous NER task,
似乎在radiology领域，nen的效果不是很有用，医生的用词比较准确。
可能在医药领域，细胞，蛋白，疾病这些领域里，命名存在更多不规范的地方。

### **Introduction to Radiology Reports and Named Entity Normalization (NEN)**  
Hello everyone, thank you for being here today. I’m excited to introduce **RadLink**, a project focused on linking clinical entities in radiology reports.

Let’s start with some background. Radiology reports are critical in healthcare. They contain detailed descriptions of a patient’s condition, observations, and diagnostic insights. However, these reports are often written in free text, making it hard to extract and standardize the information for broader use.

**Named Entity Normalization (NEN)** is a process that addresses this problem. It maps the diverse terms used in reports to a standardized ontology—here, we use the **Unified Medical Language System (UMLS)**. For example, different terms like "lung opacity" or "pulmonary infiltrate" can be normalized to a single standardized identifier. This makes it easier to analyze data across institutions and systems.

Our work builds on **RadGraph**, a dataset designed for **Named Entity Recognition (NER)** in radiology. RadGraph identifies and classifies clinical entities, but it doesn’t map them to a standard ontology. That’s where our project, RadLink, comes in.

---

### **RadLink Dataset: A New Benchmark for Radiology REN**  
To address the lack of a proper dataset for radiology NEN, we created **RadLink**, a new benchmark dataset. Let me tell you about its construction.

- We started with **425 radiology reports** from the RadGraph dataset.  
- From these, we extracted **12,388 entities**, of which about 1,250 were unique.  
- Using a multi-step process, we mapped as many entities as possible to UMLS concepts. Some entities could not be linked due to missing or ambiguous terms in the UMLS.

To ensure quality, we incorporated **human review by medical students**, treating their annotations as the gold standard. This high-quality dataset provides a strong foundation for evaluating NEN methods in the radiology domain.

---

### **RadLink Methodology**  
Now, let’s move on to the methodology. How did we normalize entities?  

We used a **three-step process**:
1. **Morphological Matching**:  
   First, we used the **UMLS API** to match entities based on their spelling. For example, if the term "lung" appeared, the API would suggest potential matches like "lung" or "lung transplantation." We ranked these matches based on similarity using an algorithm.

2. **Semantic Matching with GPT-4**:  
   Next, we handled the cases where morphological matching failed. For this, we used **GPT-4**. We gave GPT-4 the top five matches suggested by the API, along with the original term, and asked it to pick the best match or indicate if no match was possible.  

   Here’s an example of the prompt we used:  
   *"You are an expert in medical term normalization. Based on the following candidates, select the best match for the term 'lung.' If no match fits, respond 'unnormalizable.'”*

3. **Human Review**:  
   Finally, a medical student reviewed all the results. They validated the GPT-4 matches and made corrections where necessary, ensuring high accuracy.

---

### **Evaluation Metrics**  
To evaluate the performance of our normalization process, we used standard metrics:
- **True Positive (TP)**: When the prediction matches the gold standard.  
- **False Positive (FP)**: When a prediction is made, but the gold standard has no match.  
- **False Negative (FN)**: When the gold standard has a match, but the prediction does not.  
- **True Negative (TN)**: When neither the prediction nor the gold standard has a match.

Using these, we calculated:
- **Accuracy**: The proportion of correct predictions overall.  
- **Precision**: How often our predictions were correct.  
- **Recall**: How many correct entities we identified.  
- **F1 Score**: A balance between precision and recall.  

These metrics give us a comprehensive picture of our method’s performance.

---

### **Results**  
Our method achieved **90% accuracy**, a significant improvement over simpler matching approaches.  
- The **morphological matching** alone had limitations, with many false negatives.  
- Adding **GPT-4** for semantic matching drastically improved recall and overall accuracy.

These results show that combining large language models with traditional methods can handle the complexity of clinical language effectively.

---

### **Discussion**  
Let’s discuss some key points about our findings and their implications.

1. **Errors from the NER Task**:  
   The accuracy of NEN depends heavily on the NER step. If NER misidentifies or misspells an entity, normalization becomes impossible. For instance, “lung” and “Lung” might be treated as different entities, complicating the process.

2. **Limited Utility of NEN in Radiology**:  
   Interestingly, NEN might not be as critical in radiology compared to other fields. Radiologists tend to use precise and consistent language, reducing the variability that NEN addresses. However, in areas like **cell biology, protein research, or disease names**, terms are much more inconsistent, making NEN indispensable.

---

### **Impact**  
Finally, let’s talk about the broader impact of RadLink.

1. **RadLink Contributions**:  
   - RadLink is the **first standardized benchmark** for radiology NEN.  
   - It demonstrates the potential of combining traditional methods with large language models like GPT-4, setting a new standard for clinical entity normalization.

2. **Advancing AI and Healthcare**:  
   - High-quality, standardized data is essential for training better AI models.  
   - RadLink enables more accurate and efficient integration of radiology data into healthcare systems, ultimately improving patient care.  
   - By tackling entity normalization, RadLink supports the development of **data-driven AI algorithms** that can be applied to diagnostics, treatment planning, and research.

---

### **Conclusion**  
To wrap up:
- RadLink bridges the gap between NER and NEN in radiology, creating a high-quality dataset and benchmark.  
- It showcases the power of GPT-4 and similar tools in handling complex medical language.  
- While challenges remain—such as coverage gaps in UMLS and dependency on accurate NER—RadLink lays the groundwork for future advancements in healthcare AI.

Thank you for your attention. I’m happy to answer any questions.
