The symptoms occurred during rest, 2â€“3 times per week, lasted up to 30 minutes at a time and were associated with dyspnea. Except for a grade 2/6 holosystolic tricuspid regurgitation murmur (best heard at the left sternal border with inspiratory accentuation), physical examination yielded unremarkable findings.
