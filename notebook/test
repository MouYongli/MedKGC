10071193	Fibroblast growth factor homologous factor 2 (FHF2): gene structure, expression and mapping to the <category="Modifier">Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome</category> region in Xq26 delineated by a duplication breakpoint in a <category="Modifier">BFLS</category>-like patient .	<category="SpecificDisease">Borjeson-Forssman-Lehmann syndrome</category> ( <category="SpecificDisease">BFLS</category> ) is a syndromal <category="DiseaseClass">X-linked mental retardation</category> , which maps by linkage to the q26 region of the human X chromosome . We have identified a male patient with <category="Modifier">BFLS</category>-like features and a duplication , 46 , Y , dup ( X ) ( q26q28 ) , inherited from his phenotypically normal mother . Fluorescence in situ hybridisation using yeast artificial chromosome clones from Xq26 localised the duplication breakpoint to an approximately 400-kb interval in the Xq26 . 3 region between DXS155 and DXS294 / DXS730 . Database searches and analysis of available genomic DNA sequence from the region revealed the presence of the fibroblast growth factor homologous factor gene , FHF2 , within the duplication breakpoint interval . The gene structure of FHF2 was determined and two new exons were identified , including a new 5 end exon , 1B . FHF2 is a large gene extending over approximately 200 kb in Xq26 . 3 and is composed of at least seven exons . It shows tissue-specific alternative splicing and alternative transcription starts . Northern blot hybridisation showed highest expression in brain and skeletal muscle . The FHF2 gene localisation and tissue-specific expression pattern suggest it to be a candidate gene for familial cases of the <category="SpecificDisease">BFLS syndrome</category> and other syndromal and non-specific forms of <category="DiseaseClass">X-linked mental retardation</category> mapping to the region .


10021369	Identification of APC2, a homologue of the <category="Modifier">adenomatous polyposis coli tumour</category> suppressor .	The <category="Modifier">adenomatous polyposis coli ( APC ) tumour</category>-suppressor protein controls the Wnt signalling pathway by forming a complex with glycogen synthase kinase 3beta ( GSK-3beta ) , axin / conductin and betacatenin . Complex formation induces the rapid degradation of betacatenin . In <category="Modifier">colon carcinoma</category> cells , loss of APC leads to the accumulation of betacatenin in the nucleus , where it binds to and activates the Tcf-4 transcription factor ( reviewed in [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ) . Here , we report the identification and genomic structure of APC homologues . Mammalian APC2 , which closely resembles APC in overall domain structure , was functionally analyzed and shown to contain two SAMP domains , both of which are required for binding to conductin . Like APC , APC2 regulates the formation of active betacatenin-Tcf complexes , as demonstrated using transient transcriptional activation assays in APC - / - <category="Modifier">colon carcinoma</category> cells . Human APC2 maps to chromosome 19p13 . 3 . APC and APC2 may therefore have comparable functions in development and <category="SpecificDisease">cancer</category> .
